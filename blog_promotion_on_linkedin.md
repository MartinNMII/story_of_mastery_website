# Promoting Blog on Linkedin

When you publish blog content from your LinkedIn Page and link it to your blog website, it will not automatically show up on your personal LinkedIn profile. LinkedIn Pages and personal profiles are separate entities on the platform.

However, here are some ways to make sure your blog content gets visibility on your main LinkedIn profile:

- Share the Post on Your Profile: After publishing the blog content on your LinkedIn Page, you can manually share the post on your personal LinkedIn profile. This way, your network will see it in their feed, and it will also be visible on your profile under your activity.
  
- Engage with the Post: Like, comment, and share your own posts from the LinkedIn Page using your personal profile. This engagement can help increase the visibility of the post to your connections.

- Add a Link in Your Profile: You can add a link to your blog or LinkedIn Page in the 'Featured' section of your personal LinkedIn profile. This way, visitors to your profile can easily access your blog content.

- Write a Post on Your Profile: Create a new post on your personal profile announcing your latest blog post with a link to the content on your LinkedIn Page or your blog website.

- Update Your Profile: Mention your blog or LinkedIn Page in the 'About' section of your profile, ensuring that anyone who visits your profile is aware of where they can find your content.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your blog content published via your LinkedIn Page gets visibility through your personal LinkedIn profile as well.
